docker-baseimage-python
=======================

The purpose of this docker image is to provide an environment with ssh,
python, and docker, suitable for use in the development of ansible playbooks and 
roles that deploy docker containers with vagrant.

Note that this image provides docker-in-docker and thus must be run in 
privileged mode (docker run --privileged ...).
